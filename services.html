          Our main course. The best solution on the market for protecting your
          car's paintwork today. Preserves the condition of a new car for many
          years and frees you from worries about it. Protects against
          mechanical, chemical, and UV impacts on protected surfaces. We combine
          pre-cut/manual wrapping approaches to ensure the most effective
          coverage of the car. We strictly agree with the client on the scope of
          preparatory work on the car. The pre-cut method allows for complete
          coverage of the car without disassembling parts. (Relevant for new
          cars)

        <h2>Exterior Ceramic Coating</h2>
        <p>
          To maintain the shine and feel of a new car for a long period of time,
          ceramic coating is a great choice. Ceramic compositions are liquid.
          After application and crystallization, they provide protection against
          UV rays and a powerful hydrophobic effect. Unfortunately, ceramic
          coating does not protect against mechanical damage. All types of
          surfaces can be treated, including paint, glass, and plastic.

          The only solution for protecting the interior of the car is Gyeon
          LeatherShield. The ceramic coating blocks UV rays, thereby providing
          protection against fading and color loss during operation. It also
          provides a hydrophobic effect, making it much easier to clean the
          interior in the future. (Relevant for new cars)

        <h2>Ceramic Window Tinting</h2>
        <p>
          We all know how hot it can get inside a car in the summer, even when
          the air conditioning is not enough to cool the cabin. But we have a
          solution for that too. Xpel Prime XR+ tinting, with its ceramic
          coating, provides 98% blocking of thermal radiation (Infrared
          Rejection IRR). Also, let's not forget about the UV index, which is
          quite high and even dangerous for the skin. The tinting blocks the
          entire ultraviolet spectrum of rays, 100% UV rejection. The above
          properties are present in the entire range of tinting shades.

        <h2>Interior Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
          During operation, creams and grease from our bodies gradually settle
          on the seats, steering wheel, and door panels. All this mixes with
          dust and layers are retained on the surfaces. You may have noticed
          that leather seats become shiny over time, change color, and lose
          softness and elasticity. Any car needs a thorough cleaning during
          operation. Koch Chemie MZR gently and effectively helps remove
          contaminants from all types of interior surfaces of your car. Only an
          individual approach to each, even the smallest detail, can ensure a
          perfect result in cleaning. (Relevant for all types of cars)

        <h2>Exterior Polishing</h2>
        <p>
          You probably remember how your car shone in the first days after
          purchase, how rich its color was? Unfortunately, over time, that shine
          has disappeared. In its place came small and large scratches, that
          unpleasant web of scratches around the reflection of the sun. The
          color has faded, and no matter how much you wash the car, it seems it
          can't be returned. But there is a solution. Car body polishing allows
          you to get rid of scratches, thereby restoring the shine and rich
          color of the car.
        </p>
        <p>We offer 2 types of polishing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Light polishing. Allows you to quickly refresh the car, removing up
            to 60% of scratches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep polishing. Allows you to bring the car as close as possible to
            the condition of a new one, removing up to 95% of scratches. It is
            recommended to use together with Exterior Ceramic Coating.

        <p>
          That feeling when you hit a stone curb with your wheel in a parking
          lot, it's physically painful, I believe. You want to turn back time
          and not make that mistake. Alloygators give you a second chance. It is
          a plastic insert between the wheel and the tire, it is dense enough

          such damage.
